# Zoner
- Cheap asshole
- respawn too fast
- Need to make his hurtbox grow

# Game Loop
- Stale fast
- Need to enforce enemies unit order (Zoner are not starters the friggin bastards)

# Shooter 
- Shoot too fast too often. Needs to fuck around a little before shooting again

# Dasher
- ...?

# General
- Less eratic respawn

# Coins needs to exist
- Main menu should have very basic store

# Hero
- ultimate to exist
- Combos should integral part of the game loop :
-> Higher the combo the bigger the hurtbox (sfx to match)
-> Higher the combo the more often the ultimate is available
