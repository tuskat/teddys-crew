# Teddy's Crews

## Synopsis

"Teddy's Crews" is a cute parody of [Redacted], it stars some bears like creatures with insect masks fighting some obscure-like (deep-sea inspired) creatures.
The goal is to fight off waves of enemies. It is a reversed dungeon : each wave will completely change the room.
You will have a say on which room you raid (at a later date)

## Controls

- Click somewhere to dash. Dash is an attack
- Click on character to use zoning skill (To Do)

Alpha :
Action Survival :
- you have to live and level up as long as possible.
